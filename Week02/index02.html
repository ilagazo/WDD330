      <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition</h2>
      <div class="notes-sub">
      <h3>Ch 2: Programming Basics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with theC programming language.</li>
        <li>Like other languages, JS has a list of Reserved Words (short, with, yield, etc.)</li>
        <li>Variables have to be declared before they can be used. From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords const and let to declare variables. The keyword const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, 
          whereas let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</li>
        <li>This worked in much the same way as using let . The main difference was that variables declared using let and const have block scope, which is discussed in more detail below. 
          They also prevent you from overwriting any built-in methods by assignment, which is generally frowned upon, whereas using var doesn't.</li>
        <li>Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _ , or dollar character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.</li>
        <li>Variables that start with an underscore generally refer to private properties and methods, so it's best to not follow this convention for your own variable names.
          The $ character is also used by the popular jQuery library, so using this in your variable names may also cause problems.</li>
        <li>Template literals start with a " `" (backtick)</li>
        <li>Template literals can be thought of as super-powered strings as they behave in the same way as normal string literals, but with the extra power of string interpolation. For this reason, it is not uncommon to see backticks used to createallstrings in ES6 code.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is known as aweakly typedorloosely typedlanguage. This means that you don't need to explicitly specify what data-type a variable is when you declare it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard to find bugs in code, particularly when type-coercion takes place in the background.
          Strongly typedlanguages such as Java or Swift require the type of variables to be specified when they are declared. Trying to use the wrong data-type will cause an error.</li>
        <li>To convert a string to a number use "Number()" or ParseInt() or ParseFloat()</li>
        <li>To convert a number to string use the "String()"</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="notes-sub">
        <h3>Ch 3:Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>To create an Array: array literal (const myArray = [];) or array constructor (const myArray = new Array();)</li>
          <li>Both of these produce an empty array object, but it’s preferable to stick to using array literals because of avariety of reasons... and they require less typing!</li>
          <li>Mixed Arrays can contain a variety of different data types. Ex (const mixedArray = [ null, 1, [], 'two', true ];)</li>
          <li>The delete operator will remove an item from an array</li>
          <li>Destructuring Arrays is the concept of taking values out of an array and presenting them as individual values</li>
          <li>Destructuring also gives us a neat way of swapping the value of two variables and allows us to assign multiple values at the same time, using arrays </li>
          <li>Arrays have methods like pop(), push(), shift(), concat(), join(), slice(), splice(), reverse(), sort(), indexof(), includes(),and unshift().</li>
          <li>You can even have an array of arrays, known as a Multidimensional Array. This could be used to create a coordinate system, for example</li>
          <li>Sets: a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot include any duplicate values.</li>
          <li>Sets offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have been duplicated. It's also quick and easy to check if a particular value is in a set, which can be a slow operation if an array is used.</li>
          <li>Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.</li>
          <li>Weak Maps:work in the same way as weak sets. They are the same as maps, except their keys cannot be primitives, and the garbage collector will automatically remove any dead entries when the reference to the original object is deleted. </li>
          <li>Ternary Operator (?): condition ? (//code to run if condition is true) : (//code to run if condition is false)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ch 4:Functions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Function Expression assign an anonymous function a variable. (const hello = function() {}). We can also name the function</li>
          <li>Function constructors have the body of a function entered as a string. (const hi = new Function('console.log....;');). Not recommended that we declare functions this way.</li>
          <li>Parametersandargumentsare terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function isdefined. When a function isinvoked, it is provided with arguments.</li>
          <li>Default Parameters (function hello(name='World') {} )</li>
          <li>ES6 introduced a new syntax for declaring functions called thearrowsyntax. These make declaring functions much more succinct by using less verbose syntax. Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, => that gives them their name. The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable</li>
          <li>Arrow functions have a number of advantages over other ways of declaring functions:
            - They are much less verbose than normal function declarations.
            - Single parameters don't need putting into parentheses.
            - The body of the function doesn't need placing inside a block if it's only one line.
            - The return keyword isn't required if the return statement is the only statement in the body of the function.
            - They don't bind their own value of this to the function (we'll see why this is a particularly useful property when we cover objects later in the book).</li>
          <li>If the function doesn't require any parameters, a pair of empty parentheses must go before the arrow (const hello = () => alert('Hello World!');)</li>
          <li>Function Hoisting: Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and function declarations to the top of the current scope, regardless of where they are defined. Functions that are defined using a function declaration are automatically hoisted, meaning they can be invoked before they have been defined. (hoist())</li>
          <li>Callback: A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.</li>
          <li>forEach(): An alternative is to use the forEach() method. This will loop through the array and invoke a callback function using each value as an argument. The callback function takes three parameters, the first represents the value in the array, the second represents the current index and the third represent the array that the callback is being called on</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How can I simplify my code using ternary operators, for each loops, and simpler function calls?</li>
          <li>What are callback functions and why are they important? How can I apply them to code to simplfy it and make it more efficient?</li>
