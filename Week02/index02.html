      <h3>Ch 2: Programming Basics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with theC programming language.</li>
        <li>Like other languages, JS has a list of Reserved Words (short, with, yield, etc.)</li>
        <li>Variables have to be declared before they can be used. From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords const and let to declare variables. The keyword const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, 
          whereas let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</li>
        <li>This worked in much the same way as using let . The main difference was that variables declared using let and const have block scope, which is discussed in more detail below. 
          They also prevent you from overwriting any built-in methods by assignment, which is generally frowned upon, whereas using var doesn't.</li>
        <li>Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _ , or dollar character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.</li>
        <li>Variables that start with an underscore generally refer to private properties and methods, so it's best to not follow this convention for your own variable names.
          The $ character is also used by the popular jQuery library, so using this in your variable names may also cause problems.</li>
        <li>Template literals start with a " `" (backtick)</li>
        <li>Template literals can be thought of as super-powered strings as they behave in the same way as normal string literals, but with the extra power of string interpolation. For this reason, it is not uncommon to see backticks used to createallstrings in ES6 code.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is known as aweakly typedorloosely typedlanguage. This means that you don't need to explicitly specify what data-type a variable is when you declare it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard to find bugs in code, particularly when type-coercion takes place in the background.
          Strongly typedlanguages such as Java or Swift require the type of variables to be specified when they are declared. Trying to use the wrong data-type will cause an error.</li>
        <li>To convert a string to a number use "Number()" or ParseInt() or ParseFloat()</li>
        <li>To convert a number to string use the "String()"</li>
      </ul>
