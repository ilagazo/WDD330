    <h2>HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World: 2nd Edition</h2>
    <div class="notes-sub">
      <h3>Ch 8: CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transform: The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
        <li>Translation: Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. </li>
        <li>Example: "transform: translate(45px, -45px);"</li>
        <li>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively.</li>
        <li>Scaling: The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, 
          growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. </li>
        <li>ScaleX or ScaleY lets you specifically scale dimensions. Remember that scale scales the element at it's origin. The origin, or element center never moves, just the size of the element does.</li>
        <li>Rotation: The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale , by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive 
          degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.</li>
        <li>Skew: The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis.</li>
        <li>There is also skewX and skewY as with the other functions.</li>
        <li>We can also change the origin of the Transform using the "transform-origin" property.</li>
        <li>REMEMBER: The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis. </li>
        <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.</li>
        <li>transition-property: The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.</li>
        <li>transition-duration: The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state. You can specify this either in seconds ( s ) or milliseconds ( ms ). </li>
        <li>transition-timing-function: The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. Do you want your animation to start off slow and become faster, start off fast and end slower, advance at an even keel, or some other variation?</li>
        <li>transition-delay: Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins. Normally a transition begins immediately, so the default is 0 . Include the number of milliseconds ( ms ) or seconds ( s ) to delay the transition.</li>
        <li>Shorthand transition: We can easily shorthand transition by including all of these just within the transition property. For example: "transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;"</li>
        <li>Keyframes: @keyframes and @-webkit-keyframes are used to create animations (more like animation groups)</li>
        <li>animation-name: This property is used to attach an animation (previously defined using the @keyframes syntax) to an element</li>
        <li>animation-duration: The animation-duration property defines the length of time (in seconds or milliseconds) an animation takes to complete one iteration (all the way through, from 0% to 100%)</li>
        <li>animation-timing-function: the animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration.</li>
        <li>animation-iteration-count: The animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the animation will play through. </li>
        <li>animation-direction: Use this to reverse the keyframe (100% to 0%)</li>
        <li>animation-delay: The animation-delay property is used to define how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the browser begins the animation</li>
        <li>Shorthand for animation: Just like with transform, we can shorthand animation all into the animation property. For example: "animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps to create a simple transition using only CSS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
        <li>2. Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
        <li>3. Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay .</li>
